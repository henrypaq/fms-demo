# 📂 **Folder Context Menu - Implementation Complete**

## ✅ **What's Been Added**

Right-click context menu is now fully functional for folders in both:
- **Folder Sidebar** (left panel)
- **Main Grid** (folder cards in content area)

---

## 🎯 **How to Use**

### **1. Right-Click on Any Folder**
- In the **left sidebar**: Right-click any folder name
- In the **main grid**: Right-click any folder card

### **2. Context Menu Options**
- **Rename** - Change the folder name
- **Delete** - Soft-delete the folder (moves contents to parent)

---

## 📋 **Features**

### **Rename Folder**
1. Right-click folder → Click **"Rename"**
2. Modal appears with current folder name
3. Enter new name (max 50 characters)
4. Click **"Rename Folder"** or press Enter
5. Folder name updates immediately
6. Path is automatically recalculated

**Validation:**
- ✅ Name cannot be empty
- ✅ Name must be ≤ 50 characters
- ✅ No invalid characters: `< > : " / \ | ? *`
- ✅ Cannot duplicate sibling folder names

### **Delete Folder**
1. Right-click folder → Click **"Delete"**
2. Confirmation modal appears
3. Shows:
   - Folder name
   - Current location (project/parent folder)
   - Warning message
4. Click **"Delete Folder"** to confirm
5. Folder is soft-deleted (`deleted_at` set to timestamp)
6. All files move to parent folder (or project root)
7. All subfolders move to parent folder (or project root)

**Important:**
- Deletion is **permanent** (soft delete)
- All contents are preserved and moved
- No data loss occurs

## 🎨 **Modal Styling**

Both modals use the liquid glass aesthetic:
- Background: `bg-[#1A1C3A]/90` with `backdrop-blur-md`
- Border: `border-[#2A2C45]/60`
- Text: `text-[#CFCFF6]`
- Buttons:
  - Primary: `border-2 border-[#6049E3] bg-[#6049E3]/20`
  - Cancel: `bg-[#1A1C3A]/60`
  - Delete: `border-red-500 bg-red-500/20`

---

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Context Menu Handler**
```tsx
onContextMenu={(e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  e.stopPropagation();
  setFolderMenu({ folder, x: e.clientX, y: e.clientY });
}}
```

### **Menu Position**
The context menu appears at mouse cursor position:
- `x: e.clientX` (horizontal)
- `y: e.clientY` (vertical)

### **Menu Items**
```tsx
<button onClick={() => handleRename(folder)}>
  Rename
</button>
<button onClick={() => handleDelete(folder)}>
  Delete
</button>
```
